Lazy
----

This is a library that provides memoized, lazy evaluation for Elm and
data structures that exploit that. Lazy evaluation can be used to
implement infinite and circular data structures that are otherwise
impossible to define efficiently in a purely functional language like
Elm.

See the `Examples` directory in the github repo for examples.
